This project was the final assignment in Introduction to Machine Learning course at Tel-Aviv University.

Based on given data with more than 20 features that describes users behavior in E-Commerce, our goal was to build a model that would predict the probability of a specific user to make a purchase in the online site. During our project, we had to deal with different types of variables - numeric, categorical, boolean.

The pipeline included data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection, modeling and evaluation.

The chosen model Random Forest, which achieved AUC score of .
